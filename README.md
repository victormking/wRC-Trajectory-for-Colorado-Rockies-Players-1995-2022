Colorado Rockies wRC+ Trajectory Analysis (1995-2022)

Overview

This project analyzes the career trajectories of Colorado Rockies baseball players from 1995 to 2022, focusing on the wRC+ (Weighted Runs Created Plus) metric. The goal is to model and visualize the peak performance age for Rockies players and explore how their performance changes with age. The analysis uses data from the Lahman R package, applying regression techniques to understand the non-linear relationship between age and performance.
